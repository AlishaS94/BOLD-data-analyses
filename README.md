# R Data Analyses with BOLD and NCBI

## Project 1
#### This was an early project to better understand how to use R and access online databases such as BOLD that are frequently used in bioinformatics. Here the geographic distribution of locusts across Africa and South Asia is studied to determine links between species found in these regions. 

## Project 2
#### Data was obtained from NCBI for organisms in the Clupeiformes order. Supervised Machine Learning with the Random Forest and Caret packages were used to identify sequence records by their genes (CytB or COI). 

## Project 3
#### The project studied the geography and evolutionary diversification for the genus Ursus. The data for this project was obtained from BOLD Systems.
